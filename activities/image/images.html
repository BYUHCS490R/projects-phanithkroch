    <h2>Answer Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Photos that are good to encode using JPEG should be realistic images, and complex scenes with smooth, subtle color gradients and varied textures</li>
            <li>GIFs is animateed and best suited for simple, high-contrast, and low-color images rather than complex photographs. </li>
            <li>PNG allowing images to retain full quality with transparency backgrounds.</li>
            <li>To resize the photo we have to upload the photo, select the desired width/height in pixels or a percentage, maintain the original aspect ratio to avoid distortion, and save</li>
            <li>The reason that we use photo editing software rather than CSS primarily cause it will have better performance, faster page in loading the content, better iamge quality, and reduce bandwith usage.</li>
            <li>We use CSS validation to check the code to ensure it follow the correct formate and rule.</li>
